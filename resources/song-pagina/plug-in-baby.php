    <p class="lyrics">
      I've exposed your lies, baby
      The underneath no big surprise
      Now it's time for changing
      And cleansing everything
      To forget your love
      My plug in baby
      Crucifies my enemies
      When I'm tired of giving
      My plug in baby
      In unbroken virgin realities
      Is tired of living
      Don't confuse
      Baby you're gonna lose
      Your own game
      Change me
      And replace the envying
      To forget your love
      My plug in baby
      Crucifies my enemies
      When I'm tired of giving
      My plug in baby
      In unbroken virgin realities
      And tired of living
      And I've seen your loving
      Mine is gone
