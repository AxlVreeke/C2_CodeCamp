      Allow me in your tub
      Just allow me in your club
      Allow me to drink from your cup
      I'll be coming back for more
      Allow me in your dream
      Allow me in your scene
      Just allow me on your knees
      I'll be coming back for more
      Sisters, keep on rising
      Brothers, keep on rising
      This girl keeps on rising
      Keep on rising up
      All I Believe in your school
      I Believe in your rules
      I Believe in your truth
      I'll be coming back for more
      I Believe in your land
      I Believe in that man
      I Believe in your command
      I'll be coming back for more
      Sisters, Brothers, Lovers
      Keep on rising up
      Sisters, keep on rising
      Brothers, keep on rising
      This girl keeps on rising
      Keep on rising up
      Uprising, uprising
      Uprising, uprising
      Sisters, Brothers, Lovers
      This girl keep on rising up
      Sisters, keep on rising
      Brothers, keep on rising
      This girl keeps on rising
      Keep on rising up
