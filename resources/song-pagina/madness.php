    <pre class="lyrics">
      I, I can't get these memories out of my mind 
      And some kind of madness has started to evolve 
      I, I tried so hard to let you go 
      But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah 
       
      I have finally seen the light 
      And I have finally realized 
      What you mean 
      Oh oh oh 
       
      And now, I need to know is this real love 
      Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? 
      And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had 
      Like some kind of madness 
      Was taking control 
      Yeah 
       
      And now I have finally seen the light 
      And I have finally realized 
      What you need 
      Mm 
       
      And now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end) 
      And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care) 
      I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light) 
      I have finally realized (Realized) 
      I need to love 
      I need to love 
       
      Come to me, 
      Trust in your dream 
      Come on and rescue me 
      Yes I have known, I can be wrong 
      Maybe I'm too headstrong 
      Our love is 
      Madness
