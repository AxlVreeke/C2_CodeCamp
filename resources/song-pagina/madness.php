        I, I can't get these memories out of my mind 
        And some kind of madness has started to evolve 
        I, I tried so hard to let you go 
        But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah 
        
        I have finally seen the light 
        And I have finally realized 
        What you mean 
        Oh oh oh 
        
        And now, I need to know is this real love 
        Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? 
        And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had 
        Like some kind of madness 
        Was taking control 
        Yeah 
        
        And now I have finally seen the light 
        And I have finally realized 
        What you need 
        Mm 
        
        And now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end) 
        And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care) 
        I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light) 
        I have finally realized (Realized) 
        I need to love 
        I need to love 
        
        Come to me, 
        Trust in your dream 
        Come on and rescue me 
        Yes I have known, I can be wrong 
        Maybe I'm too headstrong 
        Our love is 
        Madness
