      I've paid my dues 
      Time after time 
      I've done my sentence 
      But committed no crime 
      And bad mistakes 
      I've made a few 
      I've had my share of sand 
      Kicked in my face 
      But I've come through 
       
      And we mean to go on and on and on and on 
       
      We are the champions, my friends 
      And we'll keep on fighting till the end 
      We are the champions 
      We are the champions 
      No time for losers 
      'Cause we are the champions of the world 
       
      I've taken my bows 
      And my curtain calls
      You brought me fame and fortune 
      And everything that goes with it 
      I thank you all 
      But it's been no bed of roses 
      No pleasure cruise 
      I consider it a challenge before 
      The human race 
      And I ain't gonna lose 
       
      And we mean to go on and on and on and on 
       
      We are the champions, my friends 
      And we'll keep on fighting till the end 
      We are the champions 
      We are the champions 
      No time for losers 
      'Cause we are the champions of the World 
       
      We are the champions, my friends 
      And we'll keep on fighting till the end 
      We are the champions 
      We are the champions 
      No time for losers 
      'Cause we are the champions of the World
