      Paranoia is in bloom
      The PR transmissions will resume
      They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
      And hope that we will never see the truth around
      (So come on)

      Another promise, another scene
      Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
      And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
      And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
      (So come on)

      They will not force us
      They will stop degrading us
      They will not control us
      We will be victorious
      (So come on)

      Interchanging mind control
      Come, let the revolution take its toll
      If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
      You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
      (So come on)

      Rise up and take the power back
      It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
      You know that their time's coming to an end
      We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
      (So come on)

      They will not force us
      They will stop degrading us
      They will not control us
      We will be victorious
      (So come on)

      They will not force us
      They will stop degrading us
      They will not control us
      We will be victorious
      (So come on)
