        Caffè latte (Italian: [kafˌfɛ lˈlatte, kaffe lˈlatte]), often shortened to just latte (/ˈlɑːteɪ, ˈlæteɪ/) in English,
        is a coffee drink of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk.
        The term comes from the Italian caffellatte
        or caffè latte, from caffè e latte, literally "coffee and milk";
        in English orthography either or both words sometimes have an accent on the final e (a hyperforeignism or to indicate it is pronounced,
        not the more-common silent final e of English). In northern Europe and Scandinavia,
        the term café au lait has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk.
        In France, café latte is from the original name of the drink (caffè latte);
        a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a "latte" is in French called grand crème and in German Milchkaffee or (in Austria) Wiener Melange.

        Variants include the chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.
        Coffee and milk have been part of European cuisine since the 17th century. Caffè e latte, Milchkaffee, café au lait and café con leche are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public cafés in Europe and the US seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although Kapuziner is mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in Vienna and Trieste in the 2nd half of 1700s as "coffee with cream, spices and sugar" (being the origin of the Italian cappuccino).
